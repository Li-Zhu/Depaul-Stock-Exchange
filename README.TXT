DePaul Stock Exchange (DSX)
June 2015
•	This project implemented the core functions of a Stock Exchange system which includes following modules: trading entities such as Order, Quote, and Price, Booking Service, Message Distribution System, and core algorithm to handle trading transactions. 
•	Except general OO-design principles, I also applied some design patterns including Factory Method, DTO, Singleton, and Prototype to achieve a well-structured program. 
•	Concurrency was also carefully considered and designed.
•	A simulator module with GUI was also designed to support simulation of manual or automatic stock transactions.
